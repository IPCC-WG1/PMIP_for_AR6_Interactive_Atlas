comments,G,"Comparison between simulated annual precipitation changes and pollen-based reconstructions at the Mid-Holocene (6,000 years ago). The area-averaged precipitation changes over five regions (Iturbide et al., 2020) as simulated by CMIP6 models (individually identifiable, one ensemble member per model) and CMIP5 models (blue) are shown, stretching from the tropics to high-latitudes. All regions contain multiple quantitative reconstructions: their interquartile range are shown by boxes and with whiskers for their full range excluding outliers. (Figure adapted from Brierley et al., 2020)."
